Experiments for Question B:

For 1000:
sort():0.000231seconds
insertion_sort():0.0114seconds

For 10000:
sort():0.002456seconds
insertion_sort():1.16617seconds

For 100000:
sort():0.039628seconds
insertion_sort():123.541seconds

For 1000000:
sort():0.454621seconds
insertion_sort():10406seconds

Time complexity of sort() is O(nlogn),so the time elapsed becomes ten times each turn.
Time complexity of insertion_sort() is O(n * n) = 10 * 10 = 100,so the elapsed time becomes hundred times each turn;

insertion_sort() needs more clock cycles and more inefficient than sort().
